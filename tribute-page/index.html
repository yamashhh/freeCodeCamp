                    Gustav Elijah Åhr (November 1, 1996 – November 15, 2017),
                    known professionally as Lil Peep (often stylized as LiL
                    PEEP), was an American rapper, singer, songwriter and model.
                    Helping pioneer an emo revival style of rap and rock music,
                    Lil Peep has been credited as the leading figure of the
                    2010s emo music. Born in Allentown, Pennsylvania, and raised
                    on Long Island, New York, Lil Peep started releasing music
                    on SoundCloud in 2014, using the pseudonym Lil Peep because
                    his mother had called him "Peep" since he was a child. He
                    soon became popular on the platform after releasing several
                    mixtapes, including Hellboy (2016), and for his
                    collaborations with Lil Tracy. His debut album Come Over
                    When You're Sober, Pt. 1 (2017) peaked at number 38 on the
                    Billboard 200. In October 2018, Lil Peep earned his
                    highest-charting single on the Billboard Hot 100 with
                    "Falling Down", featuring the recently deceased
                    XXXTentacion, which peaked at number 13. His second studio
                    album, Come Over When You're Sober, Pt. 2 (2018), debuted at
                    number four on the Billboard 200, making it his first US top
                    10 album. The compilation album Everybody's Everything was
                    released on the 2nd anniversary of his death. Lil Peep had
                    substance abuse issues due to his mental health conditions,
                    including depression and bipolar disorder. He died in
                    Tucson, Arizona, on November 15, 2017, two weeks after his
                    21st birthday. The Pima County Office of the Medical
                    Examiner certified the cause of death as an accidental
                    overdose of fentanyl and Xanax.
